## [1.0.8] - 2025-09-07

### 🚀 Performance

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - **Node.js Memory Optimization**: Added Node.js heap memory limit configuration (`--max-old-space-size=4096`) and memory optimization flags (`--optimize-for-size`) for better handling of large datasets
  - **Parallel Processing**: Configured UV thread pool size to 8 threads (`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8`) to enable better parallel processing performance
  - **Streaming Data Processing**: Updated workflow to use streaming approach for improved memory efficiency during data processing

### 🧹 Removed

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - **DOLT_VERSION Variable**: Removed misleading `DOLT_VERSION` variable and all references since Dolt installation always uses the latest version
  - **Version-Specific Caching**: Updated Dolt installation cache key from version-specific to `dolt-latest-` for accurate caching behavior

## [1.0.7] - 2025-09-05

### 🔧 Fixed

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - **Commit Message Syntax**: Fixed shell script syntax error in "Selective commit and push" step caused by unmatched quotes in multi-line commit message
  - **String Quoting**: Corrected quote pairing in git commit command that was causing "unexpected EOF while looking for matching quote" error

### 🧹 Removed

- **Development Files**
  - **Test File Cleanup**: Removed `src/test.ts` file that was used for local development testing

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-05

### 🔧 Fixed

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**
  - **Environment Variable Consistency**: Fixed inconsistent usage of `~` and `$HOME` environment variables in Dolt installation and PATH configuration
  - **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Standardized on `$HOME` variable usage for improved reliability across different runner operating systems
  - **Cache Path Alignment**: Ensured cache path and PATH export use consistent environment variable syntax

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-05

### 🔧 Fixed

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**
 - **Dolt Command Availability**: Fixed issue where `dolt` command was not available in the same step as PATH modification
 - **Step Separation**: Separated Dolt PATH setup and usage into distinct workflow steps for proper command availability
 - **Workflow Reliability**: Improved workflow execution reliability by ensuring proper PATH propagation between steps
 - **Reverted Invalid Fix**: Removed ineffective inline PATH export and verification approaches from previous version

## [1.0.4] - 2025-09-05

### 🔧 Fixed

- **GitHub Actions Dolt PATH Issue**
  - **Cached Binary PATH**: Fixed "dolt: command not found" error when using cached Dolt installations
  - **Explicit PATH Export**: Added `export PATH="$HOME/.dolt/bin:$PATH"` to all steps that use Dolt commands
  - **Cross-Step Compatibility**: Ensured Dolt binary is available regardless of cache hit/miss status
  - **Verification Enhancement**: Combined PATH setup with immediate verification to catch issues early

## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-04

### 🚀 Performance

- **GitHub Actions Optimization**
  - **Parallel Job Execution**: Split GitHub Action workflow into parallel jobs to significantly reduce overall execution time
  - **Smart Data Extraction**: Improved options data extraction with "Check-First, then Data" strategy:
    - Fast `COUNT(*)` query to verify data existence on target date
    - Single full data extraction query when data exists
    - Automatic fallback with latest date query and single extraction when target date unavailable
  - **Conditional Processing**: Skip unnecessary work when data is already current
  - **Enhanced Build Performance**: Skip TypeScript build when no source code changes detected
  - **Improved Caching**: Enhanced caching strategy for all build artifacts

### 🔧 Fixed

- **Workflow Configuration**
  - **Dolt Executable Path**: Fixed bug by properly shifting the command to add dolt executable to system PATH

### 📝 Changed

- **Git Workflow Enhancement**
  - **Optimized Git Configuration**: Updated commit and push workflow for improved performance and safety
  - **Safer Push Strategy**: Implemented more robust Git push strategy for better reliability

## [1.0.2] - 2025-09-02

### 🔧 Fixed

- **API Path Configuration**
  - **Documentation URLs**: Fixed API endpoint documentation to reflect correct GitHub Pages URL structure
  - **Base URL**: Removed `/api/` prefix from API documentation since GitHub Pages serves the api directory contents as root
  - **Endpoint Examples**: Updated all curl examples and documentation to use correct paths:
    - `GET /symbols.json` (instead of `/api/symbols.json`)
    - `GET /symbols/{SYMBOL}.json` (instead of `/api/symbols/{SYMBOL}.json`)
    - `GET /metadata.json` (instead of `/api/metadata.json`)
  - **JavaScript References**: Updated client-side fetch calls in documentation to use correct relative paths

### 📝 Changed

- **README Generation**: Updated README template to reflect accurate API endpoint URLs
- **API Documentation**: Corrected all endpoint examples and base URL references

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-02

### 🔧 Changed

- **Workflow Configuration Updates**
  - **Conditional Logic**: Improved branch-based deployment conditions
  - **Permissions**: Updated workflow permissions for Pages deployment
